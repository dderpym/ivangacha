overall structure
    - ivangacha is designed to be an incremental game with gacha elements
    - by resetting progress (prestiging), the player can obtain currency to attempt to pull for various ivan
    - ivan provides modifiers to the game to make progress faster
        - depending on the rarity, the ivan modifier will have differing intensity
    - add another type of currency to raise rarities?

gacha structure
    - seven rarities, with varying droprates
    - limited banners?
        - art or source material still required
        - base game first, then we will see from there
    - what to do with duplicates of the same ivan?
        - convert into different currency?
        - to raise a rarity of a card, needs this new currency and a number of copies of the ivan the player wants to raise

incremental structure
    - progression
        - tasks to obtain resources (main categories that can be specialized through tech tree?)
        - build a civilization that discovers ivan and builds their civilization around it
    - reset system
        - resetting gives the player currency that can be used to get different ivan, which provides modifiers
    - tech tree
